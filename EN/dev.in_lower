polls
this

showed
that

voters
had
about
evened
out

opposed

of
abortions
for

say
they
are
victims
of

that
those

are
enforced

loosely
that
they
open
the
way

abortions
for
other

although
a

president
may
limit
local
benefits
to
the
voter
's
particular
district\/state
,
such
a

is
also
likely
to
be
more
effective
at
preventing
other
districts\/states

their
legislators
from
bringing
home
the
local
benefits

he
hurt
himself
further
this
summer
by
bringing
homosexual
issues
into
the
debate
;
and
by
wavering
on
this
issue
and
abortion
,
he
has
weakened
his
credibility
in
what
is
already
a
mean-spirited
campaign
on
both
sides

with
industrial
growth
stagnant

easing

some

call

measures

mr.

yesterday
because

the

due

to
the
